The aim of the course is to study the current techniques and algorithms commonly used in information retrieval, Web search, Web mining and recommendation, and the challenges of these fields. The course covers a range of topics in advanced representation, retrieval and search engines, with a hands-on programming assignment where the student must apply what they learned during the lectures and exercises to build an intelligent system. My duties included: Supervising exercise sessions with the students, preparing the programming project, coaching the students in the realization of the project, and providing support to the professor.

[Detailed description of the course available here.](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02C8BE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp52736)
